* Bugs: /
* File operations
    - copy / paste (needs some sort of feedback/progress screen?)
    - (later/optional) make sure I am actually modifying the system clipboards
* Implement a proper text input for the input/prompt
* Proper pane resizing? How would that even work?
* Remove "escapeNonAscii" function and somehow handle it properly
    My locale encoding (1252) on Windows makes l√∂ve error in lg.print
    I either need to convert it to utf-8, or keep stripping like I am now
* Optimize rendering (only rerender if something changed) and only render panes that changed
* Give all gui functions optional pane-indices (remove the half-assed code right now and add this when it's needed)
