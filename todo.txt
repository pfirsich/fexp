* Bugs: /
* Scrolling when choosing options in the input palette
* Conceptual Revamp
    - Introduce the notion of a current directory and only make items be filtered out/in
* Commands
    - refresh (requires current directory too)
* File operations
    - rename
    - copy
    - paste
    - mkdir
* Implement a proper text input for the input/prompt
* Pane resizing
* Remove "escapeNonAscii" function and somehow handle it properly
    My locale encoding (1252) on Windows makes l√∂ve error in lg.print
    I either need to convert it to utf-8, or keep stripping like I am now
* Optimize rendering (only rerender if something changed) and only render panes that changed
* Give all gui functions optional pane-indices (remove the half-assed code right now and add this when it's needed)
