* Give all gui functions optional pane-indices (remove the half-assed code right now and add this when it's needed)

* Scrolling when choosing options in the input palette
* Remove "escapeNonAscii" function and somehow handle it properly
    My locale encoding (1252) on Windows makes l√∂ve error in lg.print
    I either need to convert it to utf-8, or keep stripping like I am now
* Tab view
    - "Cursor" (navigate with arrow keys)
    - Scrolling
    - Include meta data
    - Select items
    - Open file
* File operations
    - filter / glob
    - rename
    - copy
    - paste
* Optimize rendering (only rerender if something changed)
