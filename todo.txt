* Give all gui functions optional pane-indices (remove the half-assed code right now and add this when it's needed)

* Scrolling when choosing options in the input palette
* Remove "escapeNonAscii" function and somehow handle it properly
    My locale encoding (1252) on Windows makes l√∂ve error in lg.print
    I either need to convert it to utf-8, or keep stripping like I am now
* Tab view
    - Show metadata in columns, including moddate, maybe make them togglable via command?
* File operations
    - rename
    - copy
    - paste
    - mkdir
* Conceptual Revamp
    - Introduce the notion of a current directory and only make items be filtered out/in
* Commands
    - execute item in new tab
    - execute item in new pane
* Bugs
    - fix prompt/input that spawns a prompt being closed immediately
* Optimize rendering (only rerender if something changed) and only render panes that changed
