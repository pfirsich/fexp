# fexp
This is a prototype of the file explorer I wish I had. The general idea is to make "Sublime Text for file browsing" with a fuzzy matching command palette for all operations and just for navigating directories (and tabs and panes).

Obviously the difference between this prototype and a proper, reliable tool is huge, so you probably don't want to start using this for real in your everyday life. But please feel inspired and make it for real or tell me your ideas!

Here is a video I made (one take, so not really well-paced and overall flawed) that hopefully makes the idea clear:

Most commands you can use are bound to shortcuts in [main.lua](https://github.com/pfirsich/fexp/blob/master/main.lua), which therefore serves as a sort of reference for what you can do in fexp. If you are interested, have a look.

Any further plans or ideas I have for this thing are noted in [todo.md](https://github.com/pfirsich/fexp/blob/master/todo.md)
